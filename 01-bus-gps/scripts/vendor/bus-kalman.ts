// 1-D Kalman filter along a learned bus-route polyline, plus the arc-length
// geometry it needs. Consumed by layers/buses.ts for snapped buses only; buses
// without a learned route keep the straight-line dead-reckoning model.
//
// Why a filter at all: BODS fixes are sparse (~80 s per bus) and carry urban
// GPS drift, and the previous model derived velocity from the last two fixes —
// one drifted fix could fully hijack speed AND heading for the whole
// extrapolation window. The filter weights every fix by uncertainty instead,
// so a suspect fix nudges the estimate rather than owning it.
//
// Why 1-D: the learned polyline (backend learner, quality-gated at
// mean residual ≤ 35 m) already answers "where can this bus be" — projecting
// each fix onto it discards the lateral drift component entirely, and the
// filter then only has to manage along-route noise. State is (s, v): arc
// length in meters and signed line speed in m/s. All covariance math is
// scalar — no matrix library, ~5 floats per bus.
//
// Time base: state time `t` is the FIX timestamp (BODS RecordedAtTime), never
// wall clock — fixes arrive 10-30 s stale and display code coasts the state
// forward to `now` (kfCoastS) with exponentially decaying speed, so staleness
// is compensated but a silent bus glides to a halt instead of running away.

 * Process noise spectral density q, m²/s³ (continuous white-noise acceleration

 * swings the FULL 0↔8-13 m/s range within a single 20-30 s fix gap, so that
 * swing must be statistically unsurprising: σ_v(25 s) = √(q·25) ≈ 7 m/s ⇒
 * q ≈ 2. Larger q = trust fixes more; smaller = trust motion more.
 *
 * Field revision 2026-07-31: the initial 0.2 (derived as σ_v(80 s) ≈ 4 m/s,
 * i.e. a smooth-cruising model over the AVERAGE fix cadence) made the 3σ gate
 * reject honest braking/departure fixes — simulated stop-and-go showed 20-36%
 * of fixes gated, and in production every bus stop triggered gate→reset
 * cycles that displayed as fleet-wide surge-and-stall (buses sailing past
 * stops on stale speed, snapping back on reset, then sprinting to catch up).
 * At q = 2 the same simulations gate zero honest fixes, at 8 AND 13 m/s
 * cruise speeds. The lost smoothing is acceptable: the filter's real jobs
 * (along-route motion, tangent heading, teleport gating) don't depend on it.
